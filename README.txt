# LearningCards

LearningCards is a flashcard project.

LearnignCards uses spaced repetition and card siblings to increase learning.

Spaced repetition is a learning method where facts or concepts to be learned are practiced at 
different time intervals depending on a learner's mastery of the fact or concept.

Card siblings are cards that cover the same fact or concept, but with slight alterations that prevent
the learner from simply memorizing the card without learning the concept. 

For example some single addition card siblings could be: 
2 + 7 = 9  
3 + 3 = 6
1 + 4 = 5 
The learning would need to do more than simply memorize one card to demonstate mastery of addition. 

### Why card siblings are useful for spaced repetition
Different card siblings can enhance spaced repetition by making small variances to the knowledge that the
learner needs to demonstrate each time the concept comes up to be practiced in spaced repetition.
